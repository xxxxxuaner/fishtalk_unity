Bubble FX - v1.2

by Archanor VFX
=================

This asset features different scenes filled with bubbles, godray and dust particle effects.

The idea of this asset was to provide an animated ambience for main menus, but has since been updated with bubble explosions and trails that could be useful for underwater combat etc.

=================
Usage
=================

Demo scenes contain a 'BubbleCanvas' prefab as well as an EventSystem which are used for the scene selection menu in the bottom right. These can simply be deleted. If you want to use the scene selection menu, you first have to add the demo scenes to Build Settings.

=================
URP Upgrade
=================

To upgrade the asset to URP, simply find the 'Bubble FX URP 2019.3.1f1 Upgrade' unitypackage, double click it and and extract/import it to your project.

If you've upgraded by accident, you can reimport the asset from the Asset Store or the Package Manager.
